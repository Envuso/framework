# Warning:
Envuso is currently a WIP. I'm currently resolving a couple of issues and getting everything ready. Docs are incomplete and I'm often pushing updates. Wait a week or so and it should be ready to use.

## Envuso framework

Envuso is a backend framework focusing building apis using [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) support.


## Credits:

- [Inversify Express Utils](https://github.com/inversify/inversify-express-utils)
We used inversify express utils in a setup without fastify, which was very barebones but enjoyable. We used this as a small starting point,
converting it to fastify and re-writing a lot of it, to fix any pain points we had.
- [MongoDB Typescript](https://github.com/aljazerzen/mongodb-typescript) 
We used mongodb-typescript as it was a nice starting point for mongo implementation with class transformer
